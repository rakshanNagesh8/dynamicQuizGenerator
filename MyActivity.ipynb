People believed him to be an embodiment of justice on behalf of the native population, however, no one could guess his real motive - an end to British Raj.\n",

News of the governor’s death had sent shockwaves among the higher judiciary and triggered chaos among the public who had always been oppressed by the regime.\n",

      "The fight seemed never-ending, but before long, he felt his own exhaustion beginning to take its toll. The stranger spoke in a low voice - she was not here to fight him, she was there to join him. She revealed to the Indian Assassin that she was, in fact, a secret agent of the resistance, and was here to help him in the mission by distracting the guards when the time was right.\n",

      "The story of the Indian Assassin and the Secret Agent left everyone with one question - how will the aftermath of their mission turn out? To this day, no one knows the truth of what happened when the two parted, but one thing is certain - the fate of India rested in their hands.\n"
